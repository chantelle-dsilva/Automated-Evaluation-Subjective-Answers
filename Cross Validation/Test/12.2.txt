12.2 run the code for n-times and get average values, drop the constant and lowest number. for example if <br>           f(x) = 3n +1<br>the running time will bef  f(x) = O(n)
12.2 to measure the actual time of the program to run. and calculate the running time using the input and operations done
12.2 adding up the number of operations performed based on the worst case possible.
12.2 the experimental approach would be to run through the algorithm and see how long it takes
12.2 trying it with different sets of inputs, and measuring the amount of time that the algorithm actually takes.
12.2 running the input with various inputs measuring the running time with  system time
