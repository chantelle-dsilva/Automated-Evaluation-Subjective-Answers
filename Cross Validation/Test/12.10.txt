12.10 three steps<br>visit the root node, then go to right subtree, after visiting right subtree visit left subtree
12.10 log n
12.10 ( n(n-1) ) / 2<br><br>
12.10 2n-1
12.10 it takes at most h steps, where h is the height of the tree.
12.10 it depends on the install search tree then from there for whatever the case is the it repeats it back along the case of the primary node
