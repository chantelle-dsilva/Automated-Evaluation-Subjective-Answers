10.6 For every node in the binary tree we first visit its left sub-tree (if its there) and then visit the parent node itself, and then the right sub-tree (if its there).
10.6 The inorder traversal of a binary tree visits the node of a binary tree in order according to their data values.
10.6 Traverses the binary tree in inorder.  It lets you visit the nodes in order according to their data values.
10.6 Its used to visit nodes of a binary search tree in a search key order.
10.6 (Left side of tree) (Root) (Right side of tree)
10.6 printing a tree in order from least to greatest. This done by going as far left down the tree as possible and printing the parent and then right tree. Then move up the tree.
10.6 The in order is to go from left,root,right
10.6 Inorder traversal of a binary tree will retrieve start at the furthest left hand leaf and checks it, itâ€™s parent, and itâ€™s right side sibling, then it goes up a level and repeats until it gets to the root.
10.6 traverse the left subtree. visit the root. traverse the right subtree.
10.6 postorder
10.6 in order starts with the root then does right child then left child recursively
10.6 Left Child -&gt; Parent -&gt; Right Child
10.6 it goes from lowest to highest inside of the tree
10.6 starting by displaying the node furthest to the right, then  the node, then the node on the right, in recursive order.
10.6 It travels left to right
10.6 void inorder(ptNode ptr)<br>{<br>if (ptr)<br>{<br>inorder (ptr-&gt;left);<br>cout&lt;&lt;ptr-&gt;data;<br>inorder(ptr-&gt;right);<br>}<br>}
10.6 the root is in the middle.  The left subtree is traversed first, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
10.6 a traversal that visits the left branch first, then the parent node, then the right branch, recursively.
