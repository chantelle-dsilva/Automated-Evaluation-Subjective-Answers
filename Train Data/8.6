8.6 They are converted to post fix expressions.  It still follow the order of precedence for the operators.
8.6 They are first converted to postfix expressions and then evaluated.
8.6 Computers cannot evaulate infix expressions, it must first convert infix to postfix expression then it can evaluate.
8.6 By using parentheses to have order in the expression.
8.6 In postfix notation.
8.6 computers usually convert infix expressions to post fix expression and evaluate them using a stack.
8.6 they are converted to postfix
8.6 Infix expressions are interpreted as postfix expressions by implementing stacks.
8.6 They are first converted into an equivalent postfix expression so it can be read by the computer.
8.6 The computer translates the infix expression to a postfix expression, then solves.
8.6 in postfix format
8.6 they use parenthisis and a stack to determine which evaluations need to be made first
8.6 By throwing variables into a postfix expression and operands onto a parentheses regulated stack until end parentheses and enough variables to operate on are encountered. 
8.6 by being passed to the function by a leading term
8.6 i have an hard time explaining this so i'll show how infix is evaluated instead.<br>Start with an infix expression, like, <br>(((5+2)*5)+(400/(2+3))), and  push items until you get a ")" and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "("... with that complete, you will now have <br>((7*5)+(400/(2+3))) as now the expression that will be evaluated... perform last step again...<br>(35+(400/(2+3))) is now the stack.... repeat agian...<br>(35+(400/5)) is now the stack after that.... repeat...<br>(35+80) is now the stack, repeat again...<br>115 is now the stack, and is returned.
8.6 The infix expression is converted to postfix form<br>
8.6 by converting them to postfix expressions and putting the operations in a stack
8.6 The computer converts the infix expression to postfix form. Then evaluates the postfix expression.
8.6 infix expressions are converted to postfix expressions before they can be evaluated by a computer.  Operands stay in the same order.  Operators always follow the operands.
8.6 infix expressions are pointers evaluated by reference to the memory location
8.6 computers convert infix expressions to postfix form before evaluation
