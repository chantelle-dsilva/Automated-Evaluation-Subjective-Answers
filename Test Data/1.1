1.1 to show that a certain part of the program works as it is supposed to
1.1 Prototype programming is an approach to programming that enables one to take an organized approach to developing an effective program with minimal errors and a strategic pattern when solving a problem. i.e. book gave an example of a costumer withdrawing money from a bank, the approach that was taking on a pseudo code level during the OOA/Design lvl before proceeding into creating a solution.
