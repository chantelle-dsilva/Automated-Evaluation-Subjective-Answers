8.5 Array based implementation requires less memory than a list based.<br>inceasing the size of a  resizeable array can waste storage and time
8.5 in an array based stack you would need to pre-determine a size, where in a list you can increase or decrease the size however you want.
8.5 A list-based implementation is preferred because the list is more<br> flexible than a array.
8.5 i would think a list based would be better because you can change the pointers of the nodes to add or remove things from your stack
8.5 list based, because it is much more flexible, easier to use, and doesnt need to have a max size defined when it is made.
8.5 array based list is preferred because it can hold any size as long as u specify it.
