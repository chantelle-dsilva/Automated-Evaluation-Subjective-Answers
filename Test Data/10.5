10.5 A tree in which the smaller values are located on the left of a parent node and the larger values are located on the right of the parent node.
10.5 a binary search tree is a special tree in which each node has at most two children, labeled left child and right child
10.5 it is a binary tree where each node has a unique key, the left child of a node has only values less than that node, and the right child of each node has higher values than that node.
10.5 Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays.
