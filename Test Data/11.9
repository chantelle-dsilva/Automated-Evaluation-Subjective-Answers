11.9 Divide the big problem into small problem, solve small problem and join small solved elements of the problem.<br>if there is two ore more elements in the array, divide the array into parts and compare the elements, after comperison, conquer the elements. If array have n element, first half have n/2 elements
11.9 divide the array in half, sort each half, then sort them back in one array
11.9 You take a class and break down everything it is supposed to do into easily managed functions.
11.9 this is shown by the use of .cpp and header files.  by splitting the program up into smaller subsections of individual code, it becomes easier to write and keep up with as opposed to having all of your code in one file
11.9 When a problem is too big, split it into smaller problems of the same type, and solve those, then from the solutions of the smaller problem, give the solution to the larger original problem.
11.9 it is the separating of large program into smaller classes then until target is reached.
