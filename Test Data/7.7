7.7 Double linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operation are more expensive
7.7 1- each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space<br>2- the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer, more pointer operations
7.7 It takes up twice the storage needed.
7.7 using more pointers to enable the backward movement takes up more memory, having more pointers make it slightly more work to add or remove a node from the list
7.7 increased memory requirements, slightly more complicated when modifying elements in the list
