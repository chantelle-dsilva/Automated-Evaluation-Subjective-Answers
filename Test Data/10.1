10.1 A nonlinear, two-dimensional data structure.
10.1 a finite set of one or more nodes such that there is a root node and all other nodes are split into trees of lesser value than the root
10.1 A finite number of nodes such that there is one root node, each node has a certain number of children nodes, and each child is also a tree
10.1 A type of data structure in which each element is attached to one or more elements directly beneath it.
