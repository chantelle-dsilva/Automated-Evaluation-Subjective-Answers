9.5 I think array based is batter, because of fixed size, but on other had list base is more flaxible. You do not have to worry about the size
9.5 list based because you dont need to shift the elements like you do in array based queues
9.5 List-based because memory isn't constricted.<br>
9.5 list based because the array based has to have a fixed size, it cannot be added to or removed from as easily
9.5 list-based array is easier and more scalable
9.5 list based becuase an arrary based has to have an arrary size and needs to be pre-defined and can't be changed dynamically.
