7.3 Array based implementation requires less memory than lined lists based implementation
7.3 Array-based implementations require less memory than a pointer-based ones<br>
7.3 You can go up and down an array , but you can only go one direction while traversing a linked list.
7.3 arrays allow for the random access of any item cotained a any time, linked lists must be gone through toget to the desired item
7.3 In arrays you have direct access to each element, but in linked lists you have to traverse the list up to the element that you need.
7.3 Array size is fixed. But Linked is not fixed, data is also accessed quicker in array list, also memory requirement is less and no pointers required. Arrays have random access and less overheads compared to Linked list have sequential access only with too much overheads and no cache memory support. On the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. Singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction.
