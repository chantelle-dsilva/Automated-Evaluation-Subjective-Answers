1.6 inside the function scope and outside of the function scope in case of global variables
1.6 global variables are declared in the main function<br>local variables are declared in any other function
1.6 Variables are usually declared at the very beginning of a C++ program, but can be declared any in the program as long as they appear before they are called upon.
1.6 Variables are declared in the main function, before any operation is <br><br>attempted with the variables.
1.6 anywhere, but where you declare them depends on where you want them to be accessible (their scope)
1.6 It depends if itâ€™s a global then they have to be declared out side the source code to be used in every scope however a local variable is one declared in a local function etc. which obviously doesnâ€™t need to be declared outside the variable seeing how it is used for the function or block its being called for.
