7.1 A link list is a data structure which is built from structures and pointers. It forms a chain of nodes with pointers representing the links of the chain and holding the entire thing together
7.1 its a list of pointers that are linked 2 each other. every pointer points to the next pointer which has the next element
7.1 linear collection of self-referential nodes connected by pointers.
7.1 the items of a data structure are linked to each other using pointers
7.1 A list of objects where each object contains a link to the next item in the list
7.1 A linked list is one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures. It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references ("links") pointing to the next and/or previous nodes.
