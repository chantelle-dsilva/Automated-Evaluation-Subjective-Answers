5.3 insertion sort will make zero operations (and length - 1 comparisons) in the best case scenario, that is, when the array its given is already in order.
5.3 theta(n)<br>the best case senario is that everything is already sorted
5.3 n operations<br><br>The best case scenario is when all the numbers are in increasing order.
5.3 it could be considered that having only one item would be the easiest to sort, but this could also be a trivial result as nothing is moved<br><br>having two items allows the algorithm to sort the items into the correct order
5.3 the best case is if it only has to look through the list once. The best case scenario is when it goes through the list and doesn't have to make any changes (the list is already sorted)
5.3 very simplistic it moves one element from the list by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new slot then starting over. best case is (0)1
