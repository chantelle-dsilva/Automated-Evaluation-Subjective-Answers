8.4 the top is the first pointer.
8.4 Keep a pointer pointing to the last element entered at the front of<br> the array and move the pointer "back" when you delete an element.
8.4 using linked list, you are pushing the node that contains each int to the stack until you get to the end of your linked list
8.4 have a linked list, and for each push, add an item onto beginning of the list, and for each pop remove the first element in the list.
8.4 Using a linked list is one way to implement a stack so that it can handle essentially any number of elements. It is usually convenient to put a data structure in its own module, thus, you'll want to create files stack.h and a stack.c
