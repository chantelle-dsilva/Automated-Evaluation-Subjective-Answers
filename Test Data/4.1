4.1 one way of specifying of array is A[10] ;<br>other way of specifying array is a[arraysize] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
4.1 1-Initializing an array in a declaration with an initializer list<br>2-Specifying an array√¢‚¨‚¢s size with a constant variable 
4.1 Initializing the size in the brackets: int a[100];<br>Initializing the length by assigning variables: int a[] = {1,2,3};
4.1 user defined value or by the number of elements in initializer list
4.1 you can assign the size of it inside the brackets when you declare the array [3], or you can have it set by how many items you set the array equal to {1,2,3}
4.1 use an arraylist, or have your program ask the array how many elements it has. As an obj it it should have member length that is the number of slots it has.
