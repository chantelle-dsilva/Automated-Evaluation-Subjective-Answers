10.6 Inorder traversal visits the left branch of a node (all the way to it's deepest left-most leaf) before visiting the node itself. After visiting the entire left branch and the node, it visits the node's right branch following the same pattern of left child, node, right child.
10.6 left middle right
10.6 You traverse all the nodes to the left, then visit the root, then traverse all the nodes on the right.
10.6 you would go to the furthest down left most node, then to the root then to the right (if left and right exist) then you would return one node previous and do the same until you reached the root, then go to the furthest down left most node on the right side of the root and continue this process
10.6 it means that you traverse one subtree of a node, then look at the node itself before traversing the other subtree of the node
10.6 Level order traversal is a traversal method by which levels are visited successively starting with level 0 (the root node), and nodes are visited from left to right on each level, with Push and Pop methods.
