4.4 A static array cannot be changed in the program.
4.4 static arrays are available throughout the program
4.4 a static array is allocated when the program starts and is freed when the program exits but has limited scope, while an array that is not declared static is allocated and freed when it comes into and out of scope.
4.4 if they are declared fixed or static that means they can't change size once their storage has been allocated, however one that is not or dynamic arrarys can be resized.
