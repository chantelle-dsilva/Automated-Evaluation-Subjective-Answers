3.6 Either omitting the base case, or writing the recursion step incorerectly 
3.6 no base case<br>or if the programmar does not define the base case as the simplest case and it never gets reached
3.6 No easily reached base case and no base case at all
3.6 function is never allowed to reach the 'base case'
3.6 it has no base case, or the base case is never met
3.6 recursion refers to situations in which functions call themselves. These types of functions are known as recursive functions. That being said Infinite recursion occurs when the function is designed in such a way as to call it self forever without stopping possible causes
