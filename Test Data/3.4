3.4 It gives access and modify the caller's argument data directly. It eliminate the pass by value overhead of copying large amounts ofdata
3.4 it takes less memory, thus it would make the program faster
3.4 You are able to modify the variable that is referenced directly.
3.4 if you pass by reference, you can modify the value as opposed to passing by value where you cannot change the value
3.4 only the memory address is sent to the function, so no copy of the object sent needs to be made. It makes the function run faster, and saves memory.
3.4 Actual arguments are associated with dummy arguments when a function or subroutine is referenced. In a procedure reference, the actual argument list identifies the correspondence between the actual arguments provided in the list and the dummy arguments of the subprogram
