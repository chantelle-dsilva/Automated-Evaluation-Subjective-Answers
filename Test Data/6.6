6.6 There are four way to pass pointer to a function<br>1. non constant pointer to non constant data<br>2.non constant pointer to  constant data.<br>3. constant pointer to non constant data.<br>4. constant pointer to  constant data.
6.6 nonconstant pointer to nonconstant data<br>nonconstant pointer to constant data<br>constant pointer to nonconstant data<br>constant pointer to constant data
6.6 pass by value, pass by reference with reference arguments, pass by reference with pointer arguments
6.6 you can pass it where either the pointer cant be moved, the data pointed to cant be changed, or both or neither
