1.7 A do-while passes atleast 1 time before checking the condition, however, a while would fail to enter the loop if the condition fails in its first place.
1.7 a while loop checks if the condition is true or not first, if it was true, it excutes the statement.<br>a do.. while loop executes the statement before it checks the condition. if the condition was true it would excute the statement again. so a do...while loop would excute the statement atleast once.
1.7 NO ANSWER
1.7 A do...while loop will always execute atleast once, a while loop may never <br><br>execute depending on teh conditions.
1.7 a while loop is pre-check (it checks the condition statement before it executes the code within the while block)<br><br>a do while loop is post-check (it checks the condition AFTER the block executes, it runs at least once no matter what the condition statement is)
1.7 ))     What is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?<br>The do while construct consists of a block of code and a condition. First, the code within the block is executed, and then the condition is evaluated, this is done until it is proven false. The difference between the While loop is it tests the condition before the code within the block is executed.<br>
