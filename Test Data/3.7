3.7 both are based on a control statement, involve repetition and involve a termination test. both gradually approach termination, both can occur infinitely
3.7 they are used to solve the same type of problems. they do a task over and over again until a cirtain conditional statement is reached (its called the base case in recursion).
3.7 Based on control statement;  involve repetition; involve a terminal test; both can occur infinitly<br>  
3.7 repetition, termination test, eventually terminate, occur infinately
3.7 both need to have some kind of base case to tell when the loop needs to stop.
3.7 they both are able to do repetiive tasks. however recurisve calls itself with different parameters and defines and exit clause that is guaranteeed to be reached. Iterative includes a loop which iterates a pre-determined number of times, or checks for an exit clause every time through
